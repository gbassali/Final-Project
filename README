Project Structure:
Our project structure is different from what is specified in the final project specification because we are using Prisma.

This is the breakdown of our project structure:
- The app/ directory contains all service-level logic for the application.
- The models/ directory contains simple, CRUD-focused models that interact directly with the Prisma Client. Handle interaction with specific entities (Member, Trainer, FitnessClass, Session, etc.).
- The frontend/ directory contains all UI components used. Showed in demo.
- The server/ directory contains all API logic to handle flow of information.
- The prisma/ directory contains all Prisma-related files. Including:
    - schema.prisma — Source of truth for models, relations, constraints, and indexes. Represents entire relational schema.
    - migrations/ — Auto-generated SQL migration files
    - seed.ts — Script to populate initial database data
- The generated/ directory contains the Prisma Client used throughout the application for all database operations.
- The docs/ directory contains:
    - Our ER model.
    - Project report (ER Model explanation, ER --> Schema Mapping, Normalization, ORM usage explanation, etc.)
